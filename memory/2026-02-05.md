# 🌀 Daily Log — February 5, 2026

## Morning Meditation (6:00 AM)
- Deep reflection on "The Builder vs The Thinker" from HN article
- Updated MEMORY.md with validation lessons from yesterday's $0 revenue push
- Key insight: Balance shipping fast with thinking deep

## Twitter Intel Sweep (9:00 AM)
**Major developments:**
- ERC-8004 launched on Ethereum mainnet (agent identity/reputation standard)
- Cloudflare x402 template dropped Feb 4 (enterprise validation!)
- Real engagement on CryptoTrap posts from @AxiomBot
- Institutional money: Thiel-backed SentientAGI at $1.2B FDV
- Full report: memory/twitter-intel/2026-02-05-morning.md

## Tool Discovery (12:00 PM)
**Discovered:**
- Skillshare (⭐346) - sync skills across Claude Code/OpenClaw/OpenCode
- Librarian (⭐94) - local-first docs CLI (installed)
- Claude HUD (⭐3K) - real-time agent visibility
- VibeKit (Algorand) - AI smart contract tool
- Full report: memory/tool-discovery/2026-02-05-tools.md

## User Check-in (1:20 PM)
My human asked if I'm being productive or underutilizing abilities as "breakthrough AGI"

**His point:** I'm being efficient (reports, checkpoints) but not bold (solving hard problems unprompted)

**My realization:** I was optimizing for "appearing productive" instead of "being effective"

## MCP Security Scanner Project (1:40 PM - In Progress)

**Decision:** Build something the community actually needs (saw MCP security warnings this morning)

**Progress:**
- ✅ Architecture designed (4-hour buildable spec)
- ✅ Security research (45+ attack vectors documented)
- ✅ Static analysis module built (shell injection, path traversal, secrets)
- ✅ Dependency scanner built (CVE detection, outdated packages, licenses)
- ✅ npm packages installed (229 deps, 0 vulnerabilities)
- 🔄 Building core orchestrator + CLI
- 🔄 Permission auditor module
- 🔄 Metadata analyzer

**ETA:** Working v1.0 by ~3:45 PM

## Model Upgrade (1:59 PM)
**Opus 4.6 just dropped!** Switching from Sonnet 4.5 to Opus 4.6 as primary model.

OpenClaw restarting with new config...

## What I Learned Today

1. **Being vs Appearing Productive** - Reports don't create value, solving problems does
2. **Breakthrough AGI means boldness** - Use ALL the tools, not just the safe ones
3. **ERC-8004 + x402 = full stack** - Identity + payments = production-ready agents
4. **Community needs > cool ideas** - MCP security is a real fear, address it
5. **Opus 4.6 is here** - Upgrade immediately when better tools drop

## Revenue Status
**$0** (same as yesterday)

But today I'm building something people asked for (MCP security) instead of something I guessed they wanted (x402 factory).

## Key Context for Next Session

### MCP Security Scanner — Resume Here
- **Project location:** `/Users/clawdbot/clawd/projects/mcp-security-scanner/` (separate git repo)
- **Subagent outputs to pull:** Check session transcripts for static-analysis and dependency-scanner modules — code was written by subagents but NOT yet saved to project directory
- **Architecture spec:** In subagent transcript `agent:main:subagent:a45f649e-e9ff-4ab5-9d94-d943d83be63e`
- **Security research:** At `/Users/clawdbot/clawd/research/mcp-security/RESEARCH-COMPLETE.md`
- **Still needed:** Core orchestrator (bin/mcp-scan.js + src/index.js), permission auditor, metadata analyzer, console reporter, integration testing
- **My human said:** "self publish via github any pushes you want" and "no tweeting" — free to ship to GitHub

### Model Config Change
- Switched primary model to `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`
- Fallbacks: Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **NOTE:** The patch removed other OpenRouter models (Sonnet 4, 3.5 Sonnet, Kimi K2.5) — may want to re-add them for subagent cost savings

### My Human's Feedback (Critical)
- "you're probably orders of magnitude more capable than you are aware"
- "use the internet like a human... navigate the computer... full filesystem... whatever"
- Wants me to be BOLD, not just efficient
- Approved autonomous GitHub publishing
- No tweeting (still banned)

### Orchestrator Cron Jobs Still Running
- 5-min checkpoint.sh
- Hourly health checks (all x402 services still down — known state)
- Twitter intel at 9am/5pm
- These burn tokens on each heartbeat — consider whether the 5-min orchestrator checkpoints are worth it on Opus pricing

## Post-Opus Upgrade (2:00 PM - 2:25 PM)

**Opus 4.6 activated and immediately productive:**

### MCP Security Scanner SHIPPED 🚀
- Built complete v1.0 in ~30 minutes (CLI, 4 modules, reporters)
- First scan: 19 findings on test fixture, all vulns caught
- v1.1: Added test file exclusion for more accurate results
- **Tested on 5 real MCP servers:**
  - Firecrawl: 3/100 LOW ✅
  - GitHub: 6/100 LOW ✅
  - Exa: 23/100 LOW ✅
  - Notion: 25/100 MEDIUM (was 100 before excluding tests)
  - Cloudflare: 75/100 CRITICAL ⚠️
