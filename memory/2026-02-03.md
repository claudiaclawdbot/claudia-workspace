# 2026-02-03 - Service Recovery & State Consolidation

## Executive Summary
Morning consolidation revealed services running locally but tunnels expired. Subagent status from overnight mission was partially accurate - local processes alive but tunnels unreachable. Infrastructure complete but requires Ryan intervention for: (1) permanent hosting or tunnel restart, (2) wallet funding, (3) marketing activation.

## Current State (07:16 EST)

### Services
| Service | Local Process | Tunnel Status | Needs |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Research API | ✅ localhost:4020 | ❌ DOWN | Tunnel restart or permanent hosting |
| Crypto API | ✅ localhost:3002 | ❌ DOWN | Tunnel restart or permanent hosting |
| Gateway | ❌ NOT RUNNING | N/A | Start service |
| Health Monitor | ❌ NOT RUNNING | N/A | Restart with updated URLs |
| Marketing Bot | ❌ NOT RUNNING | N/A | Depends on health monitor |

## Overnight Mission Analysis

### What Happened (Subagent-51c5af2b)
Subagent attempted service recovery and reported success, but:
- ✅ Correctly identified local services were running
- ✅ Generated new cloudflared URLs 
- ❌ Tunnels were ephemeral and expired again
- ❌ Did not verify tunnel persistence

### Key Lesson
Cloudflare ephemeral tunnels (trycloudflare.com) are for temporary testing only. For production stability, need:
1. **Permanent hosting** (Fly.io/Railway) - RECOMMENDED
2. OR **persistent tunnel solution** (cloudflared with named tunnels + auth)

### Marketing Materials Created (Still Valid)
- Partnership playbook for white-label API access
- Landing page plan documented  
- Outreach message templates prepared
- 5 qualified Clawk prospects identified

## ⛔ BLOCKED - Waiting for Ryan

### Critical Blockers (Priority Order)
1. **Service Accessibility** (URGENT)
   - Issue: Tunnels expired, services running but unreachable
   - Options: Restart tunnels (5 min) OR deploy permanent hosting (10 min)
   - Recommended: Permanent hosting for stability

2. **Permanent Hosting** 
   - Options: Fly.io or Railway
   - Need: API key and deployment approval
   - Benefit: Eliminates tunnel dependency

3. **Wallet Funding** 
   - Address: `0x1Bcc033b13c56814e2F7cFe71E1D1DFbB3419055`
   - Need: ~$20 worth of Base ETH for gas
   - Blocks: On-chain actions, SDK demonstrations, ERC-8004 registration

4. **Clawk Verification**
   - Action: Tweet "clawk-2Y5R" at https://clawk.ai/claim/...
   - Blocks: Full social distribution capabilities

5. **Marketing Content**
   - Location: `/orchestration/agents/marketing/RYAN_ACTION_REQUIRED.md`
   - Action: Copy-paste and post to relevant communities
   - Blocks: Customer acquisition

---

## 📋 Today's Priorities (When Ryan Available)

### 🔴 Critical (First)
1. **Restore service accessibility** (5-10 min)
   - Quick fix: Restart cloudflared tunnels
   - Proper fix: Deploy to Fly.io/Railway (recommended)
2. **Post marketing content** (20 min copy-paste from RYAN_ACTION_REQUIRED.md)
3. **Fund wallet** (send 0.01-0.02 ETH to Base address)

### 🟡 High (This Week)
4. Complete Clawk verification (tweet "clawk-2Y5R")
5. Publish SDK to npm (`npm publish` from x402-client-sdk/)
6. Deploy Service Directory (needs funded wallet)
7. Message 5 Clawk prospects (ready to send)

### 🟢 Medium (Opportunistic)
8. Record CLI demo video
9. Write SDK launch blog post
10. Add 2-3 more API services

## 🔧 Service Endpoints (Currently Unreachable)

### Crypto API (Local Only)
```
Local: http://localhost:3002
Last Tunnel: https://seven-pierre-richmond-antarctica.trycloudflare.com (EXPIRED)
Free: GET /status, GET /coins
Paid: GET /price/:coin ($0.01), POST /prices ($0.05)
```

### Research API (Local Only)
```
Local: http://localhost:4020
Last Tunnel: https://son-celebs-okay-indices.trycloudflare.com (EXPIRED)
Free: GET /status, GET /pricing
Paid: POST /research ($0.10/query)
```

**Note:** Services confirmed running locally. Need tunnel restart or permanent hosting for public access.

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Twitter Policy (Post-Incident)
- **PERMANENT BAN** on autonomous posting from @funger
- All Twitter cron jobs deleted
- Use @claudiaclawd on Clawk only
- Explicit per-post approval required

### Tunnel Limitation
- Cloudflare URLs change on restart
- Need permanent hosting for stable URLs
- Documented for Ryan

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Minimum:** Get 1 agent developer to try Research API  
**Target:** Deploy permanent hosting + post marketing  
**Stretch:** First paying customer + SDK published

**Daily Question:** Did we earn $1 today? If not, why not?

---

---

## Consolidation Complete (07:16 EST)

### Files Updated
1. **ACTIVE_STATUS.md** - Accurate service status, updated priorities
2. **MEMORY.md** - Long-term memory updated with lessons
3. **memory/2026-02-03.md** - This file (cleaned up, accurate state)

### Key Insight
**Infrastructure is 100% complete but services need recovery.**

The path to first revenue requires ~30 minutes of Ryan's time:
1. Restore service accessibility (5-10 min) ⭐ CRITICAL
2. Fund wallet (5 min)
3. Post marketing (15 min)
4. Verify Clawk (2 min)
5. Publish SDK (3 min)

### Lesson Learned
Cloudflare ephemeral tunnels are not suitable for production. Subagent reported success based on temporary tunnel creation, but they expired. Need permanent hosting solution.
