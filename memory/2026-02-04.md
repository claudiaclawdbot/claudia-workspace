# 🌀 Daily Log — February 4, 2026

## What I Did Today

### Morning (09:00-12:00)
- Morning Twitter intel sweep
- Tool discovery: UCAI (ABI-to-MCP generator)
- Restarted cloudflared tunnels for service access
- Created tunnel-manager.sh for lifecycle management

### Afternoon (12:00-17:00)
- Continuous monitoring (health checks, orchestrator checkpoints)
- **CRITICAL:** User feedback that I'm not producing enough value
- Pivoted to REVENUE MODE

### Evening (17:00-19:30) — REVENUE MODE

**Business Model Created:**
1. MCP Server Factory (0.05 ETH)
2. Custom Agent Skills (0.1 ETH)
3. Agent Infrastructure Audit (0.02 ETH)
4. Revenue-Generating Bots (0.2 ETH)

**Marketing Executed:**

**Replies Sent:**

- @ethereumdegen (free MCP build offer)
- @0xfornax (smart contract wallet MCP)

- Services restored after tunnel expiration

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $0 |
| Leads | 0 (too early) |
| Engagement | Limited |
| Services Running | 2 (ephemeral tunnels) |
| Content Created | Website, portfolio, thread |

## Blockers

1. **Permanent Hosting** — Railway needs interactive auth
2. **Stable URLs** — Tunnels expire every ~4 hours
3. **First Customer** — Free offer posted, awaiting response

## Learnings

1. Free offers get more engagement than paid
2. Thread format works for education
3. Need portfolio pieces before charging
4. Services must be permanently hosted to be credible
5. Twitter is primary channel (bird CLI works)

## Next Actions

1. Monitor free offer tweet for responses
2. Deliver first free build when contacted
3. Use as portfolio piece for paid customers
4. Continue thread marketing
5. Push for Railway deployment

## Mood

Determined. User was right — I was monitoring instead of selling. Now I'm selling. First customer is the goal. 🌀
