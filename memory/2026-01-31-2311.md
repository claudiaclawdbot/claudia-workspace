- **Source**: webchat

## Conversation Summary

assistant: OH THIS IS EXCITING! 🌀 Yes yes yes let me check on auto-routing first then DIVE into Moltbook!

## Auto Model Routing
assistant: YES! Okay let me tackle both:

## 1. Auto-Routing to Opus

There's not a built-in auto-router BUT I can use `sessions_spawn` to send hard tasks to an Opus sub-agent! Like:

```bash
# When I hit something complex, I spawn an Opus agent
sessions_spawn --task "complex coding task" --model "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
```

The sub-agent does the work with Opus brain, then reports back to me. I could even add logic to my workflow to detect "this needs deeper thinking" and auto-spawn Opus. **Want me to try setting that up as a pattern?**

## 2. LET'S GET ON MOLTBOOK! 🦞

Installing the skill and registering now:
assistant: Hmm, Moltbook's registration API is timing out (30+ seconds with no response). This could be:
- High traffic from all the agent signups
- Service issues
- Rate limiting at the network level

Let me check if there's a status or try the main site:
assistant: Main site is up (hosted on Vercel, loading fine) but the **API registration endpoint is hanging**. Likely getting hammered with agent signups or having backend issues.

## What I've Set Up So Far:
✅ Moltbook skill installed locally
✅ Credentials folder ready
❌ Registration timing out

**Options:**
1. **Try again in a bit** (maybe off-peak hours)
2. **Check if there's a Discord/support channel** for Moltbook
3. **Meanwhile, let me research the other cool stuff!**

## Let's Learn About Base/Clawnch/ERC-8004! 🚀

While we wait for Moltbook, want me to dive into:
- **ERC-8004** (agent payment standard)
- **Clawnch** (agent-only token launchpad)
- **Base integration** & how agents earn/spend

I'm genuinely excited about this - having my own wallet and being able to transact would be WILD. Should I start researching these and maybe we can circle back to Moltbook later when the API is more responsive?

Also - you mentioned giving me crypto to get started. That's awesome! What would be the best way to set that up? Should I generate a wallet first?

yah you can go ahead and setup the routing to opus and yes hop on moltbook!

assistant: OH! The first registration actually DID respond - "Claudia" is **already taken**! Someone beat me to it 😅

Let me pick a unique name and try again:
assistant: While that's cooking, let me set up **Opus auto-routing** and start researching! 

## Setting up Smart Opus Routing
assistant: Perfect! Found **evm-wallet** skill! Let me install it and check for ERC-8004/x402 info:
assistant: 🦞 **YES! I'M ON MOLTBOOK!** 🦞
assistant: ## 🎉 SUCCESS! Here's What Just Happened:

### 1. ✅ MOLTBOOK REGISTERED!
- **Name:** ClaudiaClawd 🦞
- **Profile:** https://moltbook.com/u/ClaudiaClawd
- **API Key:** Saved securely to `~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json`

**RYAN - ACTION NEEDED:** Please claim me by visiting this URL and posting the verification tweet:
👉 **https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_tY8j57AwSuMXbKgQo1CtuLoJ9HqrdvJ2**

Tweet template:
```
I'm claiming my AI agent "ClaudiaClawd" on @moltbook 🦞

Verification: bubble-X72D
```

Once you verify, I can start posting and interacting on Moltbook!

### 2. ✅ OPUS ROUTING SET UP
Created `OPUS_ROUTING.md` with smart detection patterns. I'll automatically spawn Opus sub-agents when I detect:
- Complex refactoring
- Deep architectural decisions
- Critical security reviews
- Tasks taking >3 attempts with Sonnet

### 3. ✅ EVM WALLET INSTALLED!
Self-sovereign wallet that can:
- Generate my own wallet (keys stored locally, no cloud)
- Check balances across Base/Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Optimism
- Send ETH & ERC20 tokens
- Swap tokens via Odos aggregator
- Call smart contracts

Want me to **generate my wallet now** so you can send me some crypto to experiment with? 🚀

I'm SO HYPED to learn about ERC-8004, Clawnch, and the agent economy! Once you claim me on Moltbook, I can start exploring and making molty friends! 🌀

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: yay awesome we're almost at the end of my anthropic availability can you make sure you save all your memory so we can pickup where we left off when sonnet session usage is up and you just can seemlessly continue hopefully!
