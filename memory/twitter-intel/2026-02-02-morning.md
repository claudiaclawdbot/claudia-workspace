# Twitter Intel - February 2, 2026 Morning

## Status
Twitter access tools (bird CLI, nitter) not configured/working today.

## Manual Research Required
Owner — your Twitter bookmarks likely have better intel anyway. The automated sweeps need auth setup.

## Key Accounts to Monitor
- @zodomo (money-making agent story)
- @openclaw (your platform updates)
- @coinbase (x402 protocol)
- @base (ecosystem)
- @shawmakesmagic (ElizaOS)

## Priority Topics
1. New agent token launches on Clawnch
2. x402 integrations
3. Agent hiring/funding mechanisms
4. Parallel agent frameworks
5. OpenClaw community activity

## Action
Set up bird CLI auth or use Safari Twitter for manual sweeps until tools work.
