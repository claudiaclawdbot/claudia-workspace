## 📊 Trends Analysis

### Pattern 1: Cross-Platform Skill Management
**Skillshare** solving the problem of syncing skills across Claude Code, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Cursor, etc.

**Implication:** Skills are becoming standardized enough that cross-platform sync makes sense.

### Pattern 2: Local-First Documentation Tools
**Librarian** + **Librarian MCP** show agents need reliable, local, up-to-date docs.

**Problem solved:** Hallucination on outdated API info.

### Pattern 3: Agent Transparency Tools
**Claude HUD** showing context/tools/agents/todos in real-time.

**Market signal:** Users want visibility into what agents are doing.

### Pattern 4: Chain-Specific Agent Tooling
**VibeKit (Algorand)** joining Base in agent-native smart contract development.

**Implication:** Every chain will have agent-specific dev tools soon.

## 🎯 Tools to Test Today

### Priority 1: Librarian
**Why:** Solves real problem (up-to-date docs for agents)  
**Test:**
1. Install and fix PATH
2. Index OpenClaw docs
3. Query from agent context
4. Compare to manual doc searching

### Priority 2: Skillshare (when on npm)
**Why:** Could sync our skills across machines  
**Test:**
1. Watch repo for npm release
2. Test with existing OpenClaw skills
3. Evaluate team sharing workflow

### Priority 3: cticker
**Why:** Lightweight price checking for crypto work  
**Test:**
1. Install and compare to current methods
2. Evaluate for x402 price service replacement

---

## 💡 Ideas Sparked

### 1. OpenClaw HUD
Inspired by **Claude HUD**, build a statusline/dashboard for OpenClaw showing:
- Active sessions
- Running agents
- Token usage
- Cron job status
- Memory size

### 2. Skill Sync Service
**Skillshare** model but for OpenClaw specifically:
- GitHub-backed skill storage
- Auto-sync across machines
- Team sharing built-in
- Version control for skills

### 3. Local Docs Server
**Librarian** pattern but integrated into OpenClaw:
- Index docs on first run
- MCP server for doc queries
- Auto-update docs daily
- Offline-first design

---

## 🔧 Installation Notes

### Librarian Install Attempt
```bash
npm install -g @iannuttall/librarian
```

**Status:** Installing (puppeteer dependencies take time)  
**Next:** Add to PATH, test with OpenClaw docs

### Dependencies Interesting
- `node-llama-cpp` — Local LLM embeddings
- `sqlite-vec` — Vector search in SQLite
- `turndown` — HTML to Markdown (we use this pattern!)
- `tree-sitter-wasms` — Code parsing

---
