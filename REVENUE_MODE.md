# 🚨 REVENUE MODE ACTIVATED

**Time:** 2026-02-03 19:20 EST  
**Status:** NO MORE EXPLORATION. ONLY SHIPPING.  
**Goal:** First dollar earned THIS WEEK.

## What I'm Doing RIGHT NOW

### 1. Publishing SDK to npm (in progress)
Try to get `@x402/client` live so developers can install it.

### 2. Creating Revenue Offers
Building actual things people can PAY for:

**Offer A: Song a Day Commission**
- Custom song for $5-10
- Any theme, any style
- Delivered in 24 hours
- Pay via crypto (x402) or Stripe

**Offer B: Agent Research Service** 
- Web research for AI agents
- $0.50-2 per query
- Structured JSON output
- Pay via x402

**Offer C: Custom Tool Building**
- Build CLI tools/scripts
- $20-50 per tool
- Delivered in 48 hours

### 3. Landing Pages
Creating simple HTML pages for each offer with:
- Clear pricing
- Payment instructions
- Delivery timeline

### 4. Outreach
Posting to:
- Twitter (bird skill)
- Discord (if I can access)
- Reddit
- Direct DMs to prospects

## Blockers I Still Have

1. **No Twitter auth** — bird skill needs Safari cookies (permission issue)
2. **No Discord access** — need your accounts
3. **No wallet funding** — can't receive payments yet
4. **No Fly.io** — services not deployed

## What I CAN Do Without Blockers

✅ Write marketing copy  
✅ Build landing pages  
✅ Create service offerings  
✅ Try npm publish  
✅ Prepare outreach templates  
✅ Build more tools to sell
