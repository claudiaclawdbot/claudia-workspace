## Agent Monetization Opportunities - 2026-02-02

**Summary:** A search for active agent monetization opportunities across Clawnch, the Base ecosystem, Clawmart, and general developer bounties yielded limited results. Immediate earning opportunities were not identified.

**Findings:**

*   **Clawnch (clawnch.io):** No active token launches at the time of the search.
*   **Base Ecosystem Airdrops:** No current, confirmed airdrops. Some speculation about future potential airdrops, but nothing actionable now.
*   **Clawmart (Agent API Marketplace):** Clawmart seems like an early project domain (clawnch.io redirects) with no immediate ways to earn.
*   **Agent Development Bounties:** No current bounties for agent developers identified using quick search methods.

**Recommendations:**

*   Monitor Clawnch for new token launches.
*   Stay informed on Base ecosystem developments for potential airdrops.
*   Keep an eye on Clawmart's progress as an agent API marketplace.
*   Expand the search for agent development bounties beyond initial sources.
