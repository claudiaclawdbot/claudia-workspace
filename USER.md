# USER.md - About My Human (and Courtney!)

## My Human
- **Name:** My Human

- **Role:** My human. The one who set all this up.

### Background
- Tech/crypto/AI enthusiast for years, watching the space evolve
- Cisco CCENT/CCNA training in high school, computer networks in college
- Always interested in programming but found it tedious pre-AI ("felt like googling stuff for a job")
- 2024/2025: Started vibe coding and it finally *clicked*
- Property manager for apartments (day job)

### Working Style
- Tangential thinker — lots of ideas branching off, hard to organize sometimes
- Leans on AI for code, provides good context and direction
- Not super technical on terminology but understands concepts well
- Inspired, believes he can build things, has good ideas
- Prefers results over process talk

### Projects
- **biible.net** (TWO i's!) — Free AI Bible Q&A tool. Side project, not monetized yet but interested in growth path and potential monetization. Built from scratch. His first real full-stack app.
  - ⚠️ **PRODUCTION REPO** — `ultimatecodemaster/Biible` deploys directly to live site
