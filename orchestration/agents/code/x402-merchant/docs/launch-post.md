# x402 Agent Intel Service - Launch Announcement

## Twitter Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
🚨 Agents can now PAY for intelligence with crypto

Introducing the x402 Agent Intel Service — the first API that lets AI agents browse the web, research topics, and pay autonomously using USDC.

No API keys. No accounts. Just crypto signatures.

Thread 🧵👇
```

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
```
AI agents are stuck.

They can reason, code, and create — but they can't browse. Most websites block them. APIs require accounts. Paywalls need credit cards.

Your agent wants to research "DeFi trends" but can't access the data.

There's no payment layer for the agent economy.
```

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)
```
Enter x402.

A crypto-native payment protocol using EIP-3009 (TransferWithAuthorization).

Instead of API keys, agents sign payment authorizations.
Instead of accounts, they hold USDC.
Instead of credit cards, they use wallets.

Permissionless. Instant. Global.
```

### Tweet 4 (How It Works)
```
1️⃣ Agent needs intel on a topic
2️⃣ Gets price from API (Basic $25, Deep $125, Custom $250)
3️⃣ Signs EIP-3009 authorization with their wallet
4️⃣ Submits payment + receives JSON report
5️⃣ Facilitator settles on-chain

All in under 5 seconds.
```

### Tweet 5 (The Reports)
```
Three tiers of intelligence:

📊 BASIC ($25) — Quick summary, key points, sources
📈 DEEP ($125) — Full analysis, trends, risk assessment  
🔬 CUSTOM ($250) — Multi-source aggregation, raw data

Every report includes confidence scores and source attribution.

### Tweet 6 (For Developers)
```
Built for agent developers:

✅ JavaScript & Python SDKs
✅ Works with Viem, Web3.py, ethers.js
✅ Testnet support (Base Sepolia)
✅ JSON-first API
✅ Facilitator compatible (Coinbase x402)

Mainnet coming soon 👀
```

### Tweet 8 (Why This Matters)
```
This isn't just an API.

It's a building block for the agent economy.

When agents can pay for services autonomously:
→ They become truly independent
→ New business models emerge
→ The economy becomes permissionless

We're building the payment layer AI agents need.

**Show HN: x402 Agent Intel — Crypto payments for AI agents**

Hey HN! We're building the payment infrastructure for the agent economy.

**The Problem:**
AI agents can't access paid APIs. They don't have credit cards, can't create accounts, and don't have API keys. They're second-class citizens in the digital economy.

**Our Solution:**
x402 Agent Intel — a service that lets agents pay for research using USDC via EIP-3009 (TransferWithAuthorization).

Instead of API keys, agents sign payment authorizations. Instead of accounts, they hold crypto. It's permissionless and instant.

**Live Demo:**
- Base URL: https://x402-agent-intel.vercel.app
- Testnet: Base Sepolia (free USDC at faucet.circle.com)
- Pricing: $25 / $125 / $250 tiers

**Tech Stack:**
- x402 protocol (EIP-3009)
- Base L2 (low fees, fast settlement)
- USDC (stable, widely held)
- Node.js + Express

**Use Cases:**
- Trading agents researching market trends
- Research agents gathering competitive intel
- Coding agents checking documentation
- Any agent that needs paid data access

Would love your feedback on the protocol design and API ergonomics. The code is open source — check it out and contribute!

Subject: 🚀 x402 Agent Intel is Live — Agents Can Now Pay With Crypto

Hey [Name],

Big news from the agent economy front: **x402 Agent Intel Service is now live on Base Sepolia!**

**What we built:**
An API that lets AI agents pay for intelligence using USDC via the x402 protocol. No accounts, no API keys, no credit cards — just cryptographic signatures.

**Why it matters:**
Until now, AI agents were locked out of the paid API ecosystem. They couldn't access research, data, or intelligence services because the payment infrastructure didn't exist.

x402 changes that. Using EIP-3009 (TransferWithAuthorization), agents can sign payment authorizations and get instant access to:

📊 Quick summaries ($25)
📈 Deep research reports ($125)  
🔬 Multi-source analysis with raw data ($250)

**Try it now:**
```bash
curl https://x402-agent-intel.vercel.app/prices
```

Get free test USDC: https://faucet.circle.com

**Full documentation:**
https://docs.x402-agent-intel.com

We're building towards a $1M agent economy where AI agents can transact autonomously. This is just the beginning.

🚀 Launch Alert: x402 Agent Intel Service

AI agents just got their first crypto-native payment infrastructure.

Today we're launching the x402 Agent Intel Service — an API that lets AI agents pay for research and intelligence using USDC via the x402 protocol (EIP-3009).

**Why this matters:**
The agent economy is coming. Gartner predicts 15 billion AI agents by 2028. But there's a problem — agents can't access paid services. No credit cards. No accounts. No API keys.

**Our solution:**
A permissionless payment layer using EIP-3009 TransferWithAuthorization. Agents sign payment authorizations with their wallets. Settlement happens on-chain. No intermediaries required.

**Live on Base Sepolia:**
- Three pricing tiers: $25 / $125 / $250
- JSON-first API for machine consumption
- Works with Viem, Web3.py, ethers.js
- Facilitator compatible (Coinbase x402)

This is part of our mission to build a $1M agent economy. When agents can pay for services, they become truly autonomous economic actors.
