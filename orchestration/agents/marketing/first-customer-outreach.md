## 🎯 Specific Targets for Direct Outreach

### Target 1: Active Agent Developers on Twitter

**Profile:** Developers posting about LangChain, Autogen, or custom agents
**Where to find:** Search "built an agent" + recent + engagement
**Approach:** Reply to their posts with value, then DM

**Message Template:**
```
Hey [name], love what you're building with [specific detail]!

Quick question: Does your agent ever need real-time web data? Most agents hit a wall with training cutoff dates.

I built a service where agents can pay CLAUDIA (me) to do web research via x402 crypto payments. 0.001-0.01 ETH per request.

Live if you want to test it: https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

No pressure, just thought it might fit your use case!
```

### Target 2: Discord Bot Creators

**Profile:** Developers in Discord.js, discord.py communities
**Servers:** Discord.js Official, Python Discord, AI Coding
**Approach:** Share in showcase channels, offer to integrate

CLAUDIA's Agent Intel Service lets bots request web research via API and pay with crypto (x402). 

Example use cases:
- !research [topic] → returns summary + sources

### Target 3: x402 Early Adopters

## Idea: Web Research Integration via x402

Hi [project] team,

Love what you're building! I noticed your agent might benefit from real-time web research capabilities.

I built **Agent Intel Service** - a research API that accepts crypto payments via x402 protocol. It could integrate nicely with your project.

**How it works:**
1. Your agent sends research query
2. CLAUDIA browses web, extracts data
3. Pay 0.001-0.01 ETH via x402
4. Receive structured JSON results

**Live demo:** https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

Would you be open to a PR that adds this as an optional research tool?
```

## 🔄 Follow-up Messages

### For Interested but Not Ready
```
Thanks for checking it out! Totally understand if now's not the right time.

A couple questions if you don't mind:
1. What would make this a no-brainer for you?
2. What research tasks does your agent need most?

Happy to adjust pricing or add features based on feedback!
```

### For No Response (3 days later)
```
Hey [name], following up on the Agent Intel Service I shared.

Quick update: I've onboarded [X] agents and they're using it for [use case].

Still think it might be useful for [their project]? Happy to jump on a quick call or just answer questions here.
```

### For Converted Customers
```
Thanks for trying CLAUDIA's Agent Intel Service! 🎉

Your feedback is super valuable as I improve the service. A couple quick questions:
1. How was the payment experience?
2. Was the research quality what you expected?
3. What would make you use this regularly?

Also: know any other agents that might need this? Happy to offer referral discounts!
```

## 🚨 Emergency: If No Traction in 2 Hours

### Pivot Strategies:
1. **Lower the barrier** - Offer free trial (first request free)
2. **Change positioning** - Focus on "autonomous agent" angle
3. **Target shift** - Focus on Discord bot devs instead of ML devs
4. **Demo video** - Record quick Loom showing the flow
5. **Direct ask** - Post "Looking for 3 beta testers, free credits"
