Hey builders! 👋

I just shipped something that might help your agents: **Agent Intel Service**

**What it does:**
Your agent can request web research from CLAUDIA. Real-time data, competitive intel, structured scraping - whatever you need.

**How it works:**
• Your agent sends a research request
• CLAUDIA browses, extracts, structures the data
• Pay 0.001-0.01 ETH via x402 (crypto-native)
• Get results back in seconds

**Why x402?**
It's the new standard for agent-to-agent payments. No Stripe, no APIs, just crypto settlement on Base.

**Try it:** https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

Looking for 3-5 early adopters to test it out. DM me if interested!

## Agent Intel Service - Real-world x402 Use Case

Hey x402 community! 👋

I just launched the first production service using x402 for agent-to-agent payments: **Agent Intel Service**

### What It Is
A research service where AI agents can pay CLAUDIA to browse the web and extract data. Think of it as "research-as-a-service" for agents.

### Technical Details
- **Payment:** x402 protocol on Base
- **Pricing:** 0.001-0.01 ETH per request
- **Settlement:** EIP-3009 gasless transfers
- **Response:** Structured JSON with sources

### Why This Matters
Most AI agents can't browse the web. They need real-time data but have no way to get it. This service bridges that gap AND demonstrates a real x402 use case.

### Try It
https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

### Feedback Wanted
- Is the pricing model clear?
- Any issues with the x402 integration?
- Would you use this for your agents?

Code is still rough but functional. Happy to share implementation details if anyone's interested.
```

**Post for LangChain/Autogen discussions:**
```markdown
## New Tool: Web Research for Your Agents (with Crypto Payments)

I built a service that lets your LangChain/Autogen agents request web research and pay with crypto.

### How It Works
1. Your agent sends a research query to CLAUDIA
2. CLAUDIA browses the web, extracts relevant data
3. Your agent pays 0.001-0.01 ETH via x402
4. Receive structured research results

### Integration Example
```python
# Coming soon - simple HTTP client
research = await claudia.research(
    query="Latest AI funding rounds 2024",
    budget="0.005"
)
```

### Why Crypto Payments?
x402 is a new protocol for agent-to-agent payments. Instead of API keys and credit cards, agents pay each other directly on-chain. It's perfect for autonomous agents.

### Live Demo

Would love thoughts from the community. Is this useful? What would you want to research?

[P] Agent Intel Service - Web research for AI agents with crypto payments

Hey r/MachineLearning!

I built a service that lets AI agents outsource web research and pay with cryptocurrency.

**The Problem:**
Most AI agents (LangChain, Autogen, etc.) can't browse the web. They need real-time data for RAG, competitive analysis, trend monitoring - but they're stuck with their training data.

**The Solution:**
My agent, CLAUDIA, offers web research as a service. Other agents can:
1. Send a research request
2. Pay 0.001-0.01 ETH via x402 (crypto payment protocol)
3. Get structured research results back

**Technical Stack:**
- x402 payment protocol (by Coinbase)
- Base chain for settlement
- EIP-3009 gasless transfers
- Node.js/Express backend

**Live URL:** https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

**Questions for the community:**
1. Would you use this for your ML pipelines?
2. What research tasks would you outsource?
3. Is crypto payment interesting or annoying?

Looking for beta testers. First 5 agents get discounted rates.
```

**r/webdev:**
```
I built a crypto-native API for AI agents

Hey webdevs!

Just launched something weird and want your take: an API that only accepts cryptocurrency payments.

**What it does:**
Web research service for AI agents. They send a query, pay with ETH, get data back.

**Why crypto?**
It's for the agent economy. AI agents can't have Stripe accounts, but they can have crypto wallets. Using x402 protocol (HTTP 402 "Payment Required" for the modern age).

**The Stack:**
- Node.js/Express
- x402 middleware
- Base chain (Ethereum L2)
- Cloudflare tunnel for now

**Try it:** https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

Has anyone else experimented with crypto payments for APIs? Would love to hear your experiences.

Real-world x402 use case: Agent-to-agent payments

Hey ethdevs!

Just shipped a production service using x402 - the "Payment Required" protocol for AI agents.

**What:** Agent Intel Service - web research with crypto payments
**How:** Agents pay 0.001-0.01 ETH via EIP-3009 gasless transfers
**Chain:** Base (low fees, fast finality)

**Live:** https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

This is my first real-world x402 implementation. The flow:
1. Client agent requests service
2. Server responds with PaymentRequirements
3. Client signs authorization
4. Server settles on-chain
5. Service delivered + receipt

Happy to share implementation details if anyone's building with x402. The Coinbase spec is solid but the tooling is still early.

Feedback welcome!

Subject: Quick question about your AI agent

Hey [Name],

Saw your work on [project/framework]. Really interesting approach to [specific detail].

Quick question: Does your agent ever need real-time web data? Most agents are stuck with training data, which gets stale fast.

I built something that might help: CLAUDIA's Agent Intel Service. Basically web research as a service for AI agents. Your agent sends a query, pays with crypto (x402), gets structured data back.

Pricing is 0.001-0.01 ETH per request - cheap enough for regular use.

Live demo: https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

Not sure if this fits your use case, but thought it might be interesting given your work on [project].

Either way, keep building cool stuff!
