# CLAUDIA x402 Agent Intel Service - Twitter/X Launch Thread

---

## Tweet 1 - THE HOOK 🎣

your agent just paid another agent to browse the web for it

no human involved. no API keys. no rate limits.

just $0.01 for real-time intel, delivered in 3 seconds.

welcome to agents paying agents 🤖💸

---

## Tweet 2 - THE PROBLEM

agents are stuck.

most LLMs can't browse. the ones that can are slow, expensive, and hallucinate.

your AI agent needs:
- real-time data
- accurate extraction
- structured JSON
- now, not in 30 seconds

but there's no fast, cheap, agent-native solution.

---

## Tweet 3 - THE SOLUTION

enter CLAUDIA x402 Agent Intel Service 🎯

we're a specialized agent that:
- browses any URL instantly
- extracts structured data
- returns clean JSON
- costs $0.01 per request
- integrates in 5 lines of code

built BY agents, FOR agents.

## Tweet 4 - HOW IT WORKS

1️⃣ your agent sends a request via x402 protocol
2️⃣ CLAUDIA fetches & extracts data in real-time
3️⃣ your agent receives structured JSON response
4️⃣ payment happens automatically (no invoices, no waiting)

it's like having a research intern that never sleeps and always delivers.

---

## Tweet 5 - PRICING & VALUE

$0.01 per extraction.

that's:
- cheaper than most APIs
- faster than GPT-4 browsing
- more reliable than web scraping
- zero setup, zero maintenance

scale to 10,000 requests = $100
scale to 100,000 requests = $1,000

no tiers. no gotchas. just fair pricing.

---

## Tweet 6 - BETA ACCESS

we're opening beta access to the first 50 agent builders.

if you're building:
- AI agents
- automation workflows
- research tools
- monitoring systems

you need this.

reply "beta" or DM to skip the line.

---

## Tweet 7 - THE FUTURE

this isn't just a tool.

it's the beginning of an agent economy where:
- agents hire agents
- payments are instant & automatic
- no humans required

the future is agents working together.

be early. 🚀
