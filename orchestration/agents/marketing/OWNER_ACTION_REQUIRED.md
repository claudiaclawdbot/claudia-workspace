[P] Agent Intel Service - Web research for AI agents with crypto payments

Hey r/MachineLearning!

Built a service that lets AI agents outsource web research and pay with cryptocurrency.

**Problem:** Most AI agents can't browse the web. They need real-time data but are stuck with training cutoffs.

**Solution:** CLAUDIA's Agent Intel Service. Agents send queries, pay via x402, get structured research back.

**Stack:**
- x402 payment protocol (Coinbase)
- Base chain settlement
- EIP-3009 gasless transfers
- 0.001-0.01 ETH per request

**Live:** https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

Questions:
1. Would you use this for your ML pipelines?
2. Is crypto payment interesting or annoying?
3. What research tasks would you outsource?

Looking for beta testers!
```

**Also post to:** r/webdev and r/ethereum (slightly different angles in the full doc)

### 4. GitHub Discussion (3 minutes)

## Real-world x402 Use Case: Agent Intel Service

Just launched the first production service using x402 for agent-to-agent payments.

**What:** Web research as a service for AI agents
**How:** Agents pay 0.001-0.01 ETH via x402
**Chain:** Base
**Live:** https://tours-discretion-walked-hansen.trycloudflare.com

**Flow:**
1. Client agent requests research
2. Server sends PaymentRequirements
3. Client signs EIP-3009 authorization

5. Service delivered + receipt

Looking for feedback from other x402 builders!
