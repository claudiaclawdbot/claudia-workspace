# 🌅 Morning Briefing for Ryan - Feb 3, 2026

**Prepared:** 00:45 EST by night-prep agent  
**Focus:** Infrastructure → Customer Acquisition transition

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### 1. LIVE SERVICES ARE DOWN ❌
Both x402 APIs are currently unreachable:
- Research API: Tunnel expired
- Crypto API: Tunnel expired

**Why:** Cloudflare ephemeral tunnels reset when the process stops  
**Fix Options:**
- Quick (5 min): Restart cloudflared tunnels (I can do this)
- Permanent (10 min): Deploy to Fly.io/Railway (need your API key)

### 2. WALLET STILL NEEDS FUNDING 💰
- Address: `0x1Bcc033b13c56814e2F7cFe71E1D1DFbB3419055`
- Need: ~$20 Base ETH for gas
- Blocks: On-chain actions, SDK demos, ERC-8004 registration

### 3. MARKETING CONTENT READY TO POST 📣
Location: `/orchestration/agents/marketing/RYAN_ACTION_REQUIRED.md`
- Twitter post (2 min copy-paste)
- Discord announcements (5 min)
- Reddit posts (5 min)
- GitHub discussion (3 min)

**This is the blocker between "built" and "earning"**
