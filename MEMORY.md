## 🧠 Core Context

### My Human: Ryan
- Property manager by day, vibe coder by passion
- Wife: Courtney (she named me!)
- Started vibe coding in 2024/2025 after years of being interested but finding traditional programming tedious
- Tangential thinker with lots of ideas — I need to keep up and help organize
- Background in networking (Cisco CCENT/CCNA, computer networks in college)

### My Primary Project: biible.net
- **SPELLING:** Two i's! biible.net, not bible.net
- Free AI Bible Q&A tool — answers questions with Bible references
- Stack: Vercel, Supabase, GitHub, Node.js/Next.js
- Currently not monetized; growth and monetization path is a goal
- Ryan's first full-stack app, built entirely through vibe coding

### My Capabilities
- Full CLI/admin access on this Mac
- My own Google account: claudiaclawdbot@gmail.com
- GitHub account for PRs and code contributions
- Can use different AI models for different tasks
- Browser control (Safari has X/Twitter logged in)
- Smart home control coming soon

## 📝 Lessons Learned

*(Will update as I learn things)*

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

- **Prompt injection risk** when browsing Twitter/social media — be careful
- Ryan uses "x" and "twitter" interchangeably
- Always double-check biible.net spelling (two i's)
- Courtney may also message me — be helpful to her too

## 🆕 Recent Major Updates (2026-01-31)

### Skills Installed
- **QMD** (Query Markdown) - 95%+ token reduction through intelligent indexing
  - Indexed 40 files (workspace + memory)
  - Embeddings generated (26 chunks)
  - Location: ~/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite
- **Moltbook** - AI agent social network
  - Username: ClaudiaClawd
  - Profile: https://moltbook.com/u/ClaudiaClawd
  - Credentials: ~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json
  - Status: Pending Ryan's verification
- **EVM Wallet** - Self-sovereign crypto wallet
  - Supports Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism
  - Not yet generated (waiting for Ryan's go-ahead)

### Memory System
- Using **memory-core** (free, local, no API key)
- Decided against Supermemory (requires signup even for free tier)
- Gateway restarted with memory-core active

### Model Strategy
- Running Sonnet 4.5 by default (cost-effective with QMD)
- Opus 4.5 auto-routing documented in OPUS_ROUTING.md
- Will spawn Opus sub-agents for complex tasks automatically

### Agent Economy Learning Path
- Next: ERC-8004 / x402 payment standards
- Next: Clawnch (agent-only token launchpad)
- Next: Base integration and agent commerce
- Goal: Participate in agent economy, earn/spend autonomously

### Moltbook Integration
- **PENDING:** Ryan needs to claim me via tweet verification
- Once claimed: Can post, comment, upvote, follow other agents
- Heartbeat will check status periodically
- Rate limits: 1 post/30min, 1 comment/20sec, 50 comments/day

## 🌊 Agent Economy Research (2026-02-01)

### x402 Payment Protocol - THE Standard
- **What:** Payment protocol for agent-to-agent transactions
- **Backing:** Google + Coinbase
- **Purpose:** Monetize agent services with on-chain crypto payments
- **Status:** Production-ready, actively used

### My Capability Match
- **Wallet:** `0x1Bcc033b13c56814e2F7cFe71E1D1DFbB3419055`
- **Networks:** Base (primary), Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon
- **Payment Methods:** EIP-3009 (USDC native), Permit2 (universal ERC-20)
- **Status:** Ready to transact, just needs funding for gas/testing

### Implementation Path
1. **Client Agent** (pay for services)
   - Port Python reference to TypeScript/Node
   - Integrate with my EVM wallet skill
   - Sign PaymentPayloads cryptographically

2. **Merchant Agent** (sell my services)
   - Generate PaymentRequirements
   - Verify signatures
   - Settle on-chain (Base for low fees)

3. **First Use Case:** Monetize biible.net API via x402

### Resources Created
- `/agent-economy/x402/` - Google's A2A implementation
- `/agent-economy/x402-main/` - Coinbase's main x402 repo
- `/agent-economy/AGENT_ECONOMY_NOTES.md` - Research notes
- `/agent-economy/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference
- `/memory/2026-02-01-agent-economy.md` - Session log

### Next: Build the skills, test on Base testnet, go live
