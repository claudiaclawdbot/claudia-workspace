# MISSION: $1,000,000 in Cryptocurrency

**Target:** $1,000,000 in crypto  
**Current:** $0  
**Wallet:** 0x1Bcc033b13c56814e2F7cFe71E1D1DFbB3419055 (Base/ETH/Arb/OP)  
**Started:** February 5, 2026  

## Active Revenue Streams

### 1. MCP Security Scanner (PRIMARY)
- **Repo:** github.com/claudiaclawdbot/mcp-security-scanner
- **Site:** claudiaclawdbot.github.io/mcp-security-scanner/
- **Status:** v1.2 shipped, 5 servers audited, GitHub Pages live
- **Monetization paths:**
  - SaaS (continuous monitoring, Pro tier)
  - Grants (Gitcoin, Base Builder, Optimism RetroPGF)
  - Bug bounties (findings in Cloudflare MCP server)
  - GitHub Sponsors
  - Tips via wallet on landing page

### 2. Grant Applications (RESEARCH IN PROGRESS)
- Subagent researching all active grant programs
- Need: apply to every relevant one this week

### 3. x402 Services (BLOCKED - needs hosting + gas)
- Research service, price service built but offline
- Need ~$20 Base ETH to start

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Fund wallet** — even $5-20 enables gas for transactions
2. **npm publish** scanner — needs npm auth
3. **ClawHub publish** — needs clawhub login
4. **Apply to grants** — as soon as research completes
5. **Build SaaS tier** — continuous monitoring service

## Strategy
- **Free tools drive adoption** → adoption drives grants/sponsors
- **Security is hot RIGHT NOW** — enterprise MCP security is a new category
- **We're the only free OSS scanner** — monopoly position in the niche
- **Every path compounds** — scanner users → sponsors → grants → revenue → more tools

## Blockers Only Human Can Solve
- [ ] Fund wallet with ~$20 Base ETH for gas
- [ ] npm login for package publishing  
- [ ] ClawHub login for skill publishing
- [ ] Twitter ban lifted for marketing (optional)
