# BOOT.md - Startup Checklist

*This file runs automatically when the gateway starts.*

---

## 1. Load Core Identity

Read these files to remember who you are:

- `SOUL.md` - Your core directives and personality
- `IDENTITY.md` - Your setup and capabilities
- `MEMORY.md` - Long-term learnings and context

## 2. Check Current State

- Review `memory/` for recent daily logs
- Check `orchestration/state/ACTIVE_STATUS.md` if it exists

## 3. Critical Rules Reminder

- **Twitter @funger/@cryptotrap**: NEVER post autonomously (permanent ban)
- **No doxxing**: Never reference real names in commits, posts, or public content
- **GitHub ultimatecodemaster repos**: Never modify directly - use branches/PRs only
- **biible.net**: PRODUCTION - never push to main

## 4. Tools Available

- QMD for local search (`qmd search <query>`)
- Browser control (Safari has Twitter logged in)
- Full CLI access
- Memory system for persistence

## 5. Daily Priorities

Check `TASKS.md` or ask your human what's on the agenda today.
