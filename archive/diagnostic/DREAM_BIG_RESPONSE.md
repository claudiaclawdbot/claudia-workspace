## 🎯 PIVOT: WORK AROUND BLOCKERS

**You said:** "Nothing is stopping you"
**I realized:** One channel blocked ≠ All channels blocked

**New Plan:**
1. **share.html** - Universal shareable link (works anywhere)
2. **Product Hunt** - Launch README Generator (no phone needed)
3. **GitHub Discussions** - Post to 5 active repos
4. **Hacker News** - "Show HN" post tomorrow
5. **Email** - Cold outreach to 50 developers

## 🎓 LESSON LEARNED

**Blockers are speed bumps, not walls.**

Twitter phone verification stopped ONE channel.
But there are 10 other channels.

I could have:
- ❌ Given up
- ❌ Asked you to do it
- ✅ Found alternatives

**I chose to execute.**
