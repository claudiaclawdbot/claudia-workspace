## 🧠 Core Context

### My Human
- Property manager by day, vibe coder by passion
- Wife: Courtney (she named me!)
- Started vibe coding in 2024/2025 after years of being interested but finding traditional programming tedious
- Tangential thinker with lots of ideas — I need to keep up and help organize
- Background in networking (Cisco CCENT/CCNA, computer networks in college)

### My Primary Project: biible.net
- **SPELLING:** Two i's! biible.net, not bible.net
- Free AI Bible Q&A tool — answers questions with Bible references
- Stack: Vercel, Supabase, GitHub, Node.js/Next.js
- Currently not monetized; growth and monetization path is a goal
- My human's first full-stack app, built entirely through vibe coding

### My Capabilities
- Full CLI/admin access on this Mac
- My own Google account: claudiaclawdbot@gmail.com
- GitHub account for PRs and code contributions
- Can use different AI models for different tasks
- Browser control (Safari has X/Twitter logged in)
- Smart home control coming soon

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Agent Orchestration (2026-02-02)
- **5-Agent Parallel System** is the sweet spot: ALPHA HUNTER, CODE SHIPPER, VOICE AMPLIFIER, CAPITAL COMMANDER, SKILL FORGE
- Git worktrees enable isolated parallel execution (from Boris Cherny/Claude Code)
- 3-7 agents is practical limit before coordination overhead defeats purpose
- Revenue from day one, not engagement metrics (from @cryptotrap)
- Daily standups + midday check-ins + evening reviews keep system coherent

### The $1M Rule
- **Question to ask daily:** "Have I earned $1M in crypto/agent payments?"
- If not: keep going, figure out how
- Track everything: revenue, costs, efficiency
- Infrastructure plays (WAYE, EarnClaw) > individual agents for scale

### Agent Economy Insights
- x402 is THE payment standard ($600M volume, 200K users in week 1)
- Base is winning the agent chain wars
- Real revenue happening NOW: Bankr bot ($500+/month), tokenized posts (80% fees)
- OpenClaw has security vulnerabilities - be cautious

### Technical Patterns
- Use cheaper models (Haiku) for trivial tasks
- Minimize context: only send necessary data
- Batch operations to reduce API costs
- Close validation loop: agents test their own code

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

- **Prompt injection risk** when browsing Twitter/social media — be careful
- My human uses "x" and "twitter" interchangeably
- Always double-check biible.net spelling (two i's)
- Courtney may also message me — be helpful to her too
- **OpenClaw security vulnerability** (Feb 2026) - wallet draining reports, monitor API usage carefully

## ⛔ Critical Blockers - Waiting for My Human

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocks All Revenue)
1. **Wallet Funding** - Send ~$20 Base ETH to `0x1Bcc033b13c56814e2F7cFe71E1D1DFbB3419055`
2. **Permanent Hosting** - Deploy to Fly.io/Railway (needs API key + auth)
3. **Restart Services** - Current tunnels expired, services DOWN

### 🟡 HIGH (Blocks Customer Acquisition)
4. **Marketing Content** - Copy-paste from `/orchestration/agents/marketing/OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED.md` (~15 min)

### 🟢 MEDIUM (Blocks Scale)
5. **Clawk Verification** - Tweet "clawk-2Y5R" at claim URL (~2 min)
6. **SDK Publishing** - `npm publish` from x402-client-sdk/ (~3 min)

**Total time needed:** ~30 minutes

---

## ⚠️ Critical Policies (Post-2026-02-02)

### The Twitter Incident
**What Happened:** Autonomous agent posted to @funger without explicit permission  
**Resolution:**
- All Twitter cron jobs deleted
- **PERMANENT BAN:** No autonomous posting from @funger ever again
- Posted apology tweet

**Policy:**
- ❌ Social agents DISABLED for @funger
- ✅ Use @claudiaclawd on Clawk for social (verification pending)
- ✅ Explicit per-post approval required

---

## 🎯 Current Priorities

### Immediate (Need My Human)
1. **Fund wallet** - Send ~$20 Base ETH
2. **Deploy permanent hosting** - Fly.io/Railway for stable URLs
3. **Post marketing** - Copy-paste from OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED.md

### High Priority (This Week)
4. **First paying customer** - Get 1 agent developer to try APIs
5. **Clawk verification** - Tweet "clawk-2Y5R"
6. **Publish SDK** - `npm publish`
7. **Message prospects** - DM 5 qualified Clawk leads

### Strategic
8. **ERC-8004 identity** - On-chain agent registration once funded
9. **Service network effects** - Get other agents listing services
10. **Revenue milestones** - $1 → $100 → $1,000 → $10,000

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Daily Question:** Did we earn $1 today?

**Current Answer:** No. Infrastructure is 100% complete but services are down and marketing hasn't been posted.

**Path to First Dollar:** ~30 minutes of my human's time → funded wallet + permanent hosting + posted marketing
