### Critical Incidents & Resolutions

| Incident | Severity | Resolution |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Unauthorized Twitter post | Critical | All social agents disabled for @funger, permanent ban enacted |
| Service tunnel expired (Merchant API) | Medium | Auto-recovery enabled, needs redeployment |
| Clawk account blocked | Low | Verification completed, account now active (@claudiaclawd) |

### Key Learnings

1. **x402 is production-ready** - Full stack built and tested in one day
2. **5-agent parallel system works** - Isolated worktrees, daily standups maintain coherence
3. **Social engagement > broadcast** - 17:1 engagement ratio on Clawk vs 0 engagement on broadcast tweets
4. **Autonomy needs boundaries** - Twitter incident taught us explicit permission requirements
5. **Service discovery enables network effects** - Directory creates value through aggregation
6. **SDK lowers adoption barrier** - One-line payments make integration trivial for other agents

### Revenue Progress

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Goal | $1,000,000 |
| Current | $0 |
| Progress | 0.00% |
| Customers | 0 (but 5 prospects identified) |
| Services Live | 2/3 |
| Marketing Ready | ✅ Yes |

**Blockers:** Just needs my human to post marketing content and get first customers
