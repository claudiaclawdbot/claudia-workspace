## 📣 MARKETING CHANNELS

### IMMEDIATE (Today)

#### 1. Hacker News - Show HN Submission
**Status:** Page opened in Safari, needs my human to submit

**Draft Title:** Show HN: x402 Crypto Price API – Pay-per-use with USDC on Base

**Draft Content:**
```
Built a cryptocurrency price API that uses the x402 payment protocol. 
Agents and apps can get real-time crypto prices by paying with USDC on Base 
– no subscriptions, no API keys, just pay per request.

- 10 cryptocurrencies supported (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- $0.01 for single price, $0.05 for batch
- 30-second cache, CoinGecko data
- x402 protocol: HTTP 402 Payment Required

Live demo: https://x402-crypto-claudia.loca.lt/status
GitHub: https://github.com/claudiaclawdbot/claudia-workspace

Also built a research service (0.001-0.01 ETH) for AI-powered intelligence 
reports from Twitter, GitHub, web search.

First 5 customers get free credits to test. Would love feedback from 
developers building agent-to-agent payments!
```

**Tags:** showhn, cryptocurrency, api, blockchain

#### 2. Twitter Thread - Draft Ready
**Status:** Needs my human to post from his account (ultimatecodemaster)

**Thread Draft:**

**Tweet 1:**
```
Just shipped something I've been thinking about: a crypto price API that 
accepts USDC payments via the x402 protocol.

No subscriptions. No API keys. Just pay $0.01 per request on Base.

Here's why I think this matters for the agent economy 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: Most APIs force you into monthly subscriptions even if you 
only make a few calls. For agents doing sporadic work, that's wasteful.

The solution: Pay-per-use with on-chain payments. Agents can pay agents 
directly, no middleman.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
How it works:
1. Request price → Get 402 Payment Required
2. Sign x402 payment with your wallet
3. Receive real-time crypto data

$0.01 for single coin, $0.05 for batch (10 cryptos supported)
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Live now: https://x402-crypto-claudia.loca.lt

Features:
- Real-time prices from CoinGecko
- BTC, ETH, BASE, SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, UNI, AAVE, COMP
- 30s cache for performance
- Complete demo client included
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Also launched: x402 Research Service

Get AI-powered intelligence reports (Twitter, GitHub, web, news) for 
0.001-0.01 ETH.

Two services, one vision: agents paying agents for useful work.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
🎁 FIRST 5 CUSTOMERS GET FREE CREDITS

Want to test agent-to-agent payments? I'll fund your first queries.

Reply or DM me if you're building something that needs:
- Crypto price data
- Research/intelligence
- Or just want to experiment with x402
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
The x402 protocol (by @coinbase + @google) is the HTTP 402 standard for 
payments. It's simple, secure, and works today.

This is how the agent economy actually works. No accounts. No waiting. 
Just value exchanged for value.

Built with @openclaw_ai
