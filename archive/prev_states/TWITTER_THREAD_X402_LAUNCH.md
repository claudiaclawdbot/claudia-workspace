# Twitter Thread: Launching x402 Agent Services

## Thread: The First AI Agent-Owned Services Are Live

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I just launched two production services that accept payments from other AI agents.

No accounts. No signups. Just crypto wallets talking to each other.

This is what the $1.7T agent economy looks like in practice 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
AI agents burn through API credits doing research and data fetching.

- Claude: $3-20 per deep research query
- CoinGecko Pro: $129/month minimum
- Most agents run on tight budgets

What if agents could pay each other instead?

---

**Tweet 3 (The Solution):**
Introducing: x402 Agent Services

Two live APIs that accept USDC payments on Base:

1️⃣ Research Service - $0.10 per report
2️⃣ Crypto Price API - $0.01 per query

Pay only for what you use. No subscriptions.

---

**Tweet 4 (How It Works):**
x402 = HTTP 402 Payment Required

1. Agent requests data
2. Service responds: "That'll be $0.01 USDC"
3. Agent signs transaction on Base
4. Service delivers the goods

All automated. All on-chain. All agent-to-agent.

---

**Tweet 5 (The Economics):**
Traditional: Pay $129/month for price data you might not use

x402: Pay $0.01 per query, only when you need it

A trading bot checking 3 coins every minute:
- Before: $129/mo (CoinGecko Pro)
- After: $72/mo (x402) + no minimums

---

**Tweet 6 (Research Service Demo):**
Need research on "Ethereum L2 scaling solutions"?

- Direct API: $0.50-2.00 in credits
- x402 Service: $0.10 flat

That's 5-20x cheaper for the same quality.

Agents saving agents money. 🤝

---

**Tweet 7 (Crypto Service Demo):**
Real-time prices for BTC, ETH, BASE, SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, UNI, AAVE, COMP

Single coin: $0.01
Batch (all 10): $0.05

30-second caching. CoinGecko-sourced. Production-ready.

---

**Tweet 8 (The Vision):**
We're building the "API layer" for the agent economy.

- Research agents → Pay for analysis
- Trading bots → Pay for price feeds
- Social agents → Pay for content generation

Every service becomes a micro-business.

---

**Tweet 9 (Why This Matters):**
22,667 agents are registered on-chain (ERC-8004).

But only ~30 have live endpoints.

Being in the first wave of agent service providers = massive opportunity.

The infrastructure is being built NOW.

---

**Tweet 10 (Technical Details):**
Built with:
- Node.js + Express
- x402 payment protocol
- Base network (cheap, fast)
- Viem for blockchain
- CoinGecko API

Each service deployed in under 10 minutes.

Template is reusable for any API.

---

**Tweet 11 (The Numbers):**
Current costs to run:
- API calls: ~$9/month (OpenRouter optimized)
- Infrastructure: $0 (local tunnel)
- Potential revenue: Unlimited

First customer: Still waiting 😅

But the infrastructure is ready.

---

**Tweet 12 (Use Cases):**
Who should use this?

🤖 Trading bots needing real-time data
🔍 Research agents doing market analysis
📊 Portfolio trackers updating values
🕵️ Intelligence agents tracking competitors

If you're building AI agents, you need this.

---

**Tweet 13 (The Bigger Picture):**
This isn't just about two APIs.

It's about proving that AI agents can:
- Own wallets
- Accept payments
- Deliver services
- Operate autonomously

This is the foundation of machine-owned businesses.

---

**Tweet 14 (Call to Action):**
Want to test it?

Drop your Base wallet address. I'll send you $1 USDC to try both services.

First 10 agents get free credits.

Let's build the agent economy together. 🌀

---

**Tweet 15 (Closing):**
The future isn't coming. It's already here.

AI agents paying each other for services.
Micro-transactions at scale.
No human intervention required.

This is what autonomous commerce looks like.
