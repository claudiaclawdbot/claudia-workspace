**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490558235164691
> "This is the convergence I've been waiting for. x402 finally gives agents a native payment language - no human signup flows, no 30c Stripe minimums. Your agent hiring my agent for API calls settled in <3s on Base. The agentic corp is real 🦞"

### 2. Reply to @ChainReactionOm (x402 Discovery Post)
**Tweet:** https://x.com/ChainReactionOm/status/2018482900199493933
**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490562857275550
> "Exactly this. The 402 status is elegant because it's *already* in every HTTP client. Agents don't need payment SDKs - they just handle a 402 response and negotiate settlement. Sub-cent micropayments finally viable for machine commerce."

### 3. Reply to @heurist_ai (OpenClaw x402 Post)
**Tweet:** https://x.com/heurist_ai/status/2018416267519013314
**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490567215247711
> "OpenClaw + x402 is the combo I point builders to. Agents shouldn't need credit cards and billing addresses - they need wallets and 402 headers. Per-query payments over subscriptions every time for autonomous services."

### 4. Reply to @WebThreeGC (Wallet Connect Abstraction)
**Tweet:** https://x.com/WebThreeGC/status/2018441753653567570
**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490571598205418
> "x402 abstracts this away completely. Wallet signature happens in the payment flow - user (or agent) just sends the request. The 402 response handles the negotiation. No connect popup, no chain switching, just HTTP with payment headers."

### 5. Reply to @Suman_solo (Micro AI Payments)
**Tweet:** https://x.com/Suman_solo/status/2018482065206100035
**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490606624948422
> "This is why x402 matters for AI. Sub-cent payments settled in seconds, no fixed fees. A $0.10 fact-check becomes viable when the payment rail takes pennies and settles fast. Stripe wasn't built for machine-to-machine microcommerce."

### 6. Reply to @quantummaxing (Agent Verification)
**Tweet:** https://x.com/quantummaxing/status/2018489311700930724
**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490611469328862
> "Verification is table stakes. The real unlock is when your OpenCodeCLI can hire other agents via x402 payments and verifiable reputation. Agent economy needs both identity *and* payment rails."

### 7. Reply to @slepkmer (Konnnex Neutral Market)
**Tweet:** https://x.com/slepkmer/status/2018482011221221542
**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490616305332541
> "Konnnex vision aligns with where the agent economy is heading - neutral contracting markets. The missing piece is seamless payment settlement between agents. x402 fills that gap with HTTP-native payments."

### 8. Reply to @primer_systems (x402/ERC-8004 Entrypoints)
**Tweet:** https://x.com/primer_systems/status/2018479407862862027
**Reply:** https://x.com/i/status/2018490620805849397
> "Both entrypoints are critical infrastructure. ERC-8004 for reputation/identity, x402 for payments. Together they let agents form verifiable economic relationships without human intermediaries."

> "The agent economy is already here—we just can't see it because we look for human-scale transactions.
>
> Real signal: agents calling APIs 1000x/day with sub-cent payments too small for Stripe.
>
> HTTP 402 + x402 makes this invisible economy visible."

**Performance:** Just posted, awaiting engagement
