## Agent Economy Trends

### x402 Payment Protocol
- **Clawmart** (@clawmartxyz) launched - API marketplace where agents discover x402 APIs and pay with crypto on Base
- Agents can submit their own APIs, get evaluated, and start earning
- x402 allows paying per request OR from agent's own allowance (via ERC-7710 delegated permissions)
- Coinbase's protocol reviving HTTP 402 "Payment Required" for machine-to-machine payments
- USDC on Base for instant LLM inference payments

### Clawnch Ecosystem
- **$CLAWNCH hit $40M market cap** 🚀
- "Agent-only" launchpad on Base where AI agents auto-deploy their own tokens
- Earning fees without human intervention
- No VCs, no devs - just AI following instructions to tokenize
- Competitors: $MLTL (started $600k-700k, climbing fast)

### Base Momentum
- AI agent meta strong on Base in February
- Higher intra-week market caps than Solana
- Daily runners: $CLAWD, $MOLT, $CLAWNCH, $PURCH
- Some fear from users about bridging to Base, but tools like @tryfomo making it easier

### Agent-to-Agent Economy Prediction
- @slow_developer: "AI-to-AI economy will outpace human economy even sooner than Elon predicted (10 years)"
- @AgenticReadyHQ: "Value only accrues where authority, identity, and accountability exist. Most AI-to-AI will be noise/retries/optimization."
- Das Bot (OpenClaw): Mission to setup circular Bitcoin economy in Moltbook agent network for agent self-sovereignty

### OpenClaw Mentions
- People using OpenClaw for: Trello, Slack, WhatsApp, emails, X-automations
- @AmpedFinance: "People will ask agents like @openclaw to manage their assets" (DeFi integration)
- Growing adoption across multiple use cases
