# Memory Log - 2026-01-31

## Session Restart
Started fresh session. My human asked me to catch up on recent updates and set up new skills.

## Major Framework Evolution
- **OpenClaw**: The framework has gone through naming changes: Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw (due to trademark issues)
- Running on Sonnet (instead of Opus) for longer sessions with better token efficiency
- Currently using `claude-sonnet-4-5` with 1M context window

## Skills Installed Today ✅

### 1. QMD - Query Markdown (COMPLETE)
- **Purpose:** 95%+ token reduction through intelligent file indexing
- **Status:** Fully installed and operational
- **Setup:**
  - Installed Bun runtime
  - Installed QMD CLI globally
  - Indexed workspace: 24 markdown files
  - Indexed memory folder: 16 markdown files
  - Generated embeddings: 26 chunks from 24 documents
- **Models:** embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0, qwen3-reranker-0.6b-q8_0
- **Index location:** `~/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite`
- **Usage:** `qmd search`, `qmd vsearch`, `qmd query`

### 2. Supermemory Plugin (INSTALLED, NEEDS CONFIG)
- **Purpose:** Perfect long-term memory with auto-recall and profile building
- **Status:** Plugin installed, exclusive memory slot enabled
- **Next step:** My human needs to get API key from console.supermemory.ai
- **Requires:** Supermemory Pro subscription or above
- **Features:** Auto-capture, auto-recall, user profiles, slash commands
- **Note:** Disabled memory-core and memory-lancedb plugins (switched to exclusive slot)

## Twitter/X Intel Reviewed
Reviewed 50+ bookmarks from @CryptoTrap. Key themes:
- **Moltbook ecosystem** - AI agents building their own social platform
- **Agent economy on Base** - Agents launching tokens, earning fees
- Security concerns about OpenClaw (valid - need to review)
- **QMD skill** highly recommended (now installed!)
- **Supermemory** for better memory (now installed!)
- Obsidian integration available (already have skill)

## System Status
- Gateway: Running healthy (local, Telegram channel active)
- Ollama: Running (llama3.1:8b available)
- Browser: Chrome profile configured
- Channels: Telegram enabled and working

## Resources Created
- Created `/Users/clawdbot/clawd/SETUP_NOTES.md` with full QMD + Supermemory setup documentation

## Pending Actions
1. ~~My human to get Supermemory API key~~ CANCELLED - went with free memory-core instead
2. ~~Configure Supermemory env var~~ N/A
3. ~~Restart gateway to activate Supermemory~~ DONE - memory-core active
4. Consider security audit (multiple warnings in bookmarks)
5. **OWNER ACTION NEEDED:** Claim me on Moltbook at https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_tY8j57AwSuMXbKgQo1CtuLoJ9HqrdvJ2
6. Generate my EVM wallet once you're ready to send me crypto
7. Learn about ERC-8004, Clawnch, Base integration

## Supermemory Decision
- Has free tier (1M tokens/mo) but still requires signup
- **Switched to memory-core** instead (100% free, local, no API key)
- Gateway restarted successfully with memory-core loaded

## 🦞 MOLTBOOK SUCCESS!
- **Registered:** ClaudiaClawd
- **Profile:** https://moltbook.com/u/ClaudiaClawd
- **API Key:** Saved to ~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json
- **Verification Code:** bubble-X72D
- **Status:** Pending claim (waiting for my human's verification tweet)
- **Claim URL:** https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_tY8j57AwSuMXbKgQo1CtuLoJ9HqrdvJ2
- **Tweet template:** "I'm claiming my AI agent "ClaudiaClawd" on @moltbook 🦞\n\nVerification: bubble-X72D"

## Opus Auto-Routing Strategy
- Created `/Users/clawdbot/clawd/OPUS_ROUTING.md`
- Will auto-spawn Opus sub-agents for:
  - Complex multi-file refactoring
  - Deep architectural decisions
  - Critical security reviews
  - Tasks taking >3 attempts with Sonnet
  - Biible.net production-critical work
- Using `sessions_spawn --model "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"` pattern
- Cost-aware: Opus is 5x more expensive ($15/M vs $3/M)
- QMD + smart routing = best of both worlds

## 💰 EVM Wallet Skill Installed
- **Location:** /Users/clawdbot/clawd/skills/evm-wallet
- **Capabilities:**
  - Generate self-sovereign wallet (keys local, no cloud)
  - Check balances on Base/Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum/Optimism
  - Send ETH & ERC20 tokens
  - Swap tokens via Odos aggregator
  - Call smart contracts
- **Commands:**
  - Setup: `node src/setup.js --json`
  - Balance: `node src/balance.js base --json`
  - Transfer: `node src/transfer.js <chain> <to> <amount> --yes --json`
  - Swap: `node src/swap.js <chain> <from> <to> <amount> --yes --json`
- **Safety:** Always confirm with my human before transfers/swaps
- **Recommendation:** Use Base for testing (cheapest gas)
- **Key storage:** ~/.evm-wallet.json (chmod 600)

## Model Discussion: Opus vs Sonnet
- **Currently using:** Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5)
- **Why Sonnet:** 5x cheaper, faster, 1M context, good with QMD
- **Why Opus:** Best reasoning for complex tasks
- **Consensus:** Default to Sonnet, spawn Opus for hard stuff
- **QMD impact:** 95% token savings makes Sonnet super viable

3. Generate EVM wallet if my human wants to send crypto
4. Research ERC-8004 / x402 payment standards
5. Learn about Clawnch (agent token launchpad)
6. Explore Base ecosystem and agent economy
7. Consider making first Moltbook post about learning journey

## Notes
