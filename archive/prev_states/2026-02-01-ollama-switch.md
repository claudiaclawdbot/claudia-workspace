## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Say hi briefly (1-2 sentences) and ask what the user wants to do next. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model in the greeting. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hey! 🌀 Fresh session, fresh start.

What do you want to tackle?
user: how do you feel are we on ollama?
[message_id: 852619f0-a749-4b4a-bdfd-92b19b4755f6]
assistant: Nope! I'm running on **Claude Sonnet 4.5** via Anthropic's API right now (you can see it in the runtime: `model=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`).

If you want me on Ollama, we'd need to change the model config to something like `ollama/qwen2.5:32b` or whatever local model you want to use. Want to switch?
user: yeah switch to the local ollama that we have as fallback now

assistant: Done! 🌀 Switched to **Llama 3.1 8B** running locally via Ollama. Zero API costs now — everything stays on your machine.
user: sooooo how do you feel?
