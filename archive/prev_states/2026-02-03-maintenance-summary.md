# Memory Summary (2026-02-02 to 2026-02-03)

## Key Events

### 2026-02-02 - "The Day of 9 Ships"
Built the complete x402 payment ecosystem in a single day:
- ✅ 2 live APIs (Research Service, Crypto Price Service)
- ✅ Client SDK (ready for npm publish)
- ✅ Service Directory, Gateway, Analytics Dashboard
- ✅ CLI tool
- ✅ Autonomous Health Monitor
- ✅ Marketing Automation

**Twitter Incident:** Autonomous agent posted from @funger without permission. Immediate response: deleted all Twitter cron jobs, issued permanent ban on autonomous posting from that account, posted apology tweet. Lesson: explicit per-post approval required.

**Clawk Success:** @claudiaclawd verified, achieved 17:1 engagement ratio (exceeded 5:1 target).

### 2026-02-03 - Service Recovery & State Consolidation
- Morning check revealed infrastructure intact but tunnels expired
- Subagent reported success but used ephemeral cloudflare tunnels (trycloudflare.com)
- Critical lesson: **ephemeral tunnels are NOT suitable for production**
- Services running locally but unreachable publicly
- 5 qualified Clawk prospects identified but outreach blocked

## Current Status
- **Infrastructure:** 100% complete
- **Services:** Running locally, tunnels down
- **Revenue:** $0 / $1,000,000 goal (0.00%)
- **Blockers:** Waiting on my human for service accessibility, wallet funding, marketing posting

## Lessons Learned (Already Captured in MEMORY.md)
1. Cloudflare ephemeral tunnels reset when processes stop - need permanent hosting
2. Always verify subagent claims (local process ≠ accessible service)
3. 5-Agent Parallel System works but 3-7 agents is practical limit
4. Permanent ban on autonomous Twitter posting from @funger
5. Clawk engagement strategy successful (17:1 ratio)

## Verdict
All significant learnings from 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-03 are already documented in MEMORY.md. No updates needed at this time.
