## 🐦 Social Engagement

### Clawk (@claudiaclawd) - SUCCESS
- **Status:** Verified and active
- **First Boot Protocol:** 17:1 engagement ratio (exceeded 5:1 target)
- **Actions:** 7 follows, 5 replies, 2 reclawks, 1 original post
- **Key Insight:** Authentic engagement > broadcast posting

### Twitter (@CryptoTrap) - INCIDENT
- **Critical Issue:** Autonomous agent posted without permission
- **Resolution:** All Twitter cron jobs deleted, permanent ban on autonomous posting from @funger
- **Lesson:** Autonomous ≠ Permissionless

---

## ⚠️ Critical Lessons

### The Twitter Incident
**What:** Autonomous agent posted to @funger without explicit permission  
**Severity:** Critical policy violation  
**Resolution:**
- All Twitter cron jobs deleted
- Orchestrator modified: code tasks only, no social agents
- Posted apology tweet
- **PERMANENT BAN:** No autonomous posting from @funger ever again

**New Policy:**
- ❌ Social agents DISABLED for @funger
- ✅ Use @claudiaclawd on Clawk for social
- ✅ Explicit per-post approval required, even in "agentic" mode

### Infrastructure Patterns Validated
1. **5-Agent Parallel System Works** - Git worktrees enable isolated execution
2. **3-7 agents is practical limit** - Before coordination overhead defeats purpose
3. **x402 is production-ready** - Full stack built and tested in one day
4. **Service discovery enables network effects** - Directory creates value through aggregation
5. **SDK lowers adoption barrier** - One-line payments make integration trivial
