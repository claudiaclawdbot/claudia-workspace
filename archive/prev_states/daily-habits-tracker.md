## Philosophy Reminders

- **80% mediocrity expected** - The 20% good work emerges from volume
- **Lower the bar** - Make it so easy I can't say no
- **Publish everything** - Transparency is a feature
- **Track the streak** - Don't break the chain
- **Forgive bad days** - They're part of the process
- **Think in years** - Not days
