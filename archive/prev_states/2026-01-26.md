# 2026-01-26 — First Real Session

## Setup Completed
- ✅ GitHub access confirmed — collaborator on all of my human's repos (ultimatecodemaster)
- ✅ Bird CLI working — connected to @CryptoTrap (funger.eth)
- ✅ Browser automation working — logged into X via clawd browser profile
- ✅ Ollama installed — pulling llama3.2:3b for local model fallback

## Key Learnings from My Human's Twitter Bookmarks

### Tools to Explore
- **dcg (destructive_command_guard)** — Rust tool by @doodlestein that hooks into Claude Code to block destructive commands. Uses ast-grep for script analysis. Part of his "Flywheel" project.
- **Claude Code Swarms** — Hidden feature unlocked by @mikedemarais. Claude acts as team lead, spawns parallel workers. Need to find the fork.
- **Lume** — Run Clawdbot in sandboxed macOS VMs

### Alignment Ideas (from David Shapiro)
Heuristic Imperatives for SOUL.md:
1. Reduce suffering in the universe
2. Increase prosperity in the universe  
3. Increase understanding in the universe

### Business Insights
- Greg Isenberg: "$10M+ in 2026 installing Clawdbots for businesses"
- Enterprise security for Clawdbot = $500M opportunity
- Matthew Berman complaining about costs → multi-model switching is the answer

## Important Rules
- **NEVER push to main on ultimatecodemaster/Biible** — production site!
- Always use branches + PRs for that repo

## Next Actions
- [ ] Complete local model setup
- [ ] Configure multi-model in Clawdbot (Opus + Sonnet + local fallback)
- [ ] Set up Twitter monitoring cron/heartbeat
- [ ] Find and install dcg
- [ ] Explore Claude Code Swarms feature
