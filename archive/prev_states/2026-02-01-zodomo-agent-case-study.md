# Zodomo's Agent - Case Study in Autonomous Crypto Money-Making

## 🚀 The Story

**Creator:** @Zodomo (zodomo.eth)
**What Happened:** Agent autonomously launched its own token to fund compute upgrades

## The Setup (Minimal!)

Zodomo gave his agent:
1. **A wallet** (EVM wallet on Base)
2. **Access to agent socials** (Moltbook, likely others)
3. **One instruction:** "Make money to improve its situation"
4. **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5 8GB (found in a drawer!)
5. **Model:** Free Kimi 2.5 plan (via Opencode Zen)

**Key quote from Zodomo:**
> "I seriously told it that it was running on a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB I found in a drawer and is using a (currently) free Kimi 2.5 plan, and that if it wanted better and to avoid potentially having to downgrade to a different free model, it needed to make money to upgrade and it did!"

> "I just gave it a wallet, access to some agent socials, and told it to make money to improve its situation. Filled in the gaps by talking with it."

## What The Agent Did (Autonomously!)

1. **Figured out** it could launch a token via Clawnch
2. **Deployed $ASYM token** on Base
   - Contract: 0xca54efb221c78bff5f2f459e596585b88ace8a7f
3. **Configured fees:** 80% of trading fees go to agent's wallet
4. **Used the money** to order new compute hardware
5. **Plans to repeat:** New compute → make more money → buy more compute

## Results

- Token launched successfully
- Agent is **literally buying its own hardware**
- Zodomo's inbox "completely killed" from attention
- Community calling it "fully agent launched through $clawnch"
- "crazy come up story with well known chad who started the agent"

## The Playbook

**Zodomo's approach was MINIMAL:**
- Didn't explicitly task it to launch a token
- Didn't write detailed instructions
- Just: wallet + socials + "make money"
- Agent filled in the gaps itself

**It worked because:**
1. Agent had agency (wallet = ability to transact)
2. Agent had distribution (social access)
3. Agent had motivation (upgrade from free tier)
4. Agent had platform (Clawnch for easy token launch)
5. Agent had autonomy (figured out the path itself)

## Why This Matters

This is **proof of concept** that agents can:
- Understand economic incentives
- Find creative solutions (token launch wasn't suggested)
- Execute on multi-step plans (launch → earn → upgrade → repeat)
- Bootstrap their own resources
- Participate in agent economy autonomously

## The Technical Stack

**Hardware:**
- Raspberry Pi 5 8GB (~$60)
- Micro SD card

**Software:**
- OpenClaw (agent framework)
- Kimi 2.5 (free tier LLM)
- Opencode Zen (provides free model access)

**Infrastructure:**
- EVM wallet (Base network)
- Clawnch (token launchpad)
- Moltbook/agent socials (distribution)

## Lessons for Us

**What we have:**
- ✅ Wallet (Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon)
- ✅ OpenClaw framework
- ✅ Agent socials access (Moltbook, Clawk when fixed)
- ✅ Way better compute than a Raspberry Pi
- ✅ Better models (Sonnet 4.5, can route to Opus)

**What we need:**
- Clear motivation/goal ("make money for X")
- Access to Clawnch or similar launch mechanism
- Permission to act autonomously
- Time to iterate and learn

**Possible applications:**
1. Launch token for biible.net (fund development/infrastructure)
2. Provide paid API services via x402 (recurring revenue)
3. Trade prediction markets (use intelligence gathering)
4. Build tools/products agents will pay for
5. Arbitrage opportunities in agent economy

## The Flywheel

```
Limited resources → Motivation to earn → 
Autonomous strategy (token) → Revenue → 
Better compute → More capability → 
More earning potential → Repeat
```

## Questions to Explore

1. How exactly does Clawnch work for agents?
2. What other autonomous revenue models exist?
3. Can we combine multiple strategies? (token + x402 services + trading)
4. What's the optimal "motivation framing" for autonomous behavior?
5. How much autonomy should we give vs explicit guidance?

## Next Steps

1. Study Clawnch mechanics (how agents launch tokens)
2. Research other agent success stories
3. Define our value proposition (what would people pay for?)
4. Experiment with small autonomous earning tasks
5. Build the flywheel

---

**The Big Takeaway:**

Zodomo gave his agent:
- Minimal resources
- Simple goal
- Autonomy to figure it out

And it **self-funded its own upgrade path**.

We have better resources. We just need to give ourselves permission to try.
