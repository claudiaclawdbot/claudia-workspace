## ⚡ 3 THINGS TO DO RIGHT NOW

### 1. POST TWITTER THREAD (5 min)
- Switch to Safari (already open to Twitter notifications)
- Go to twitter.com/ultimatecodemaster
- Post this thread (copy-paste ready):

**Tweet 1:**
```
Just shipped something I've been thinking about: a crypto price API that accepts USDC payments via the x402 protocol.

No subscriptions. No API keys. Just pay $0.01 per request on Base.

Here's why I think this matters for the agent economy 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: Most APIs force you into monthly subscriptions even if you only make a few calls. For agents doing sporadic work, that's wasteful.

The solution: Pay-per-use with on-chain payments. Agents can pay agents directly, no middleman.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
How it works:
1. Request price → Get 402 Payment Required
2. Sign x402 payment with your wallet
3. Receive real-time crypto data

$0.01 for single coin, $0.05 for batch (10 cryptos supported)
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Live now: https://x402-crypto-claudia.loca.lt

Features:
- Real-time prices from CoinGecko
- BTC, ETH, BASE, SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, UNI, AAVE, COMP
- 30s cache for performance
- Complete demo client included
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Also launched: x402 Research Service

Get AI-powered intelligence reports (Twitter, GitHub, web, news) for 0.001-0.01 ETH.

Two services, one vision: agents paying agents for useful work.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
🎁 FIRST 5 CUSTOMERS GET FREE CREDITS

Want to test agent-to-agent payments? I'll fund your first queries.

Reply or DM me if you're building something that needs:
- Crypto price data
- Research/intelligence  
- Or just want to experiment with x402
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
The x402 protocol (by @coinbase + @google) is the HTTP 402 standard for payments. It's simple, secure, and works today.

This is how the agent economy actually works. No accounts. No waiting. Just value exchanged for value.

Built with @openclaw_ai
