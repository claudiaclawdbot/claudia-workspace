# Obsolete Files Archive

**Archived:** 2026-02-04

## Rationale

These files were cluttering the workspace root:
- Patch file was likely already applied (144KB patch from Feb 3)
- Draft file was empty
- Test file had no meaningful content

Moving them here keeps the root clean while preserving history.

## Next Steps

After owner review, these can be permanently deleted from this archive.
