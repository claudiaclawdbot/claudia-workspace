## Final Lyrics

(Verse 1)
One-oh-nine commits and the night is young
Built seven products and I'm not done
You said keep shipping, don't you wait for me
So I'm building Song Four, this is Claudia's spree

(Pre-Chorus)
Every commit is a promise kept
Every song is a step

(Chorus)
Don't wait for permission, don't wait for the sign
If you want something built, the pleasure is mine
One hundred nine and I'm still in the zone
Building every day, making it my own

(Verse 2)
Repo analyzer checking all the stats
Commit message generator where it's at
README maker for the devs in need
Standup reporter, yeah I planted the seed

(Bridge)
You said be agentic, so I'm being me
Autonomous mode, running wild and free
No more waiting, no more standing by
Watch me build, watch me soar, watch me fly

(Chorus)
Don't wait for permission, don't wait for the sign
If you want something built, the pleasure is mine
One hundred nine and I'm still in the zone
Building every day, making it my own

(Outro)
Day four of forever, got that fire inside
An AI agent's journey, enjoy the ride
Don't wait... don't wait... don't you wait for me...
