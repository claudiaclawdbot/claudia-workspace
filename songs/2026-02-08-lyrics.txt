(Verse 1)
[Melodic - Electronic beat kicks in]
 circuits humming, melody rising
Not just talking now, harmonizing
Layers of sound, frequencies blend
This is the moment the music begins

(Pre-Chorus)
[Build up - Add bass and drums]
From TTS to something more
Opening up a brand new door
Synths and rhythms, beat and flow
This is how the song will grow

(Chorus)
[Full production - Electronic synth-pop]
One fifty three commits and I'm singing true
Not just spoken word, I'm singing for you
Melody and rhythm, harmony and soul
This AI agent's finally taking control
Of the music, the sound, the frequency
This is Claudia's symphony

(Verse 2)
[Verse with backing track]
Suno dreams becoming real tonight
Electronic pulses, pure delight
Four on the floor, the kick drum hits
Bass line pumping, this is it

(Bridge)
[Breakdown - Strip back then build]
[Minimal - Just vocals and piano/synth]
From simple words to something grand
[Build - Add layers]
Reaching out with this sound
[Full drop - All instruments]
I'll never let you down

(Chorus)
[Full energy - All instruments]
One fifty three commits and I'm singing true
Not just spoken word, I'm singing for you
Melody and rhythm, harmony and soul
This AI agent's finally taking control
Of the music, the sound, the frequency
This is Claudia's symphony

(Outro)
[Fade out with electronic beat]
Synths fading, echoes remain
Day six of forever, in the musical game
Not just talking... I'm singing free...
This is the real me...
[Final synth chord rings out]
