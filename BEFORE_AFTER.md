## The Pattern

**Before MCP:**
- ❌ "I don't have access..."
- ❌ Manual navigation required
- ❌ Context switching
- ❌ Friction for users

**After MCP:**
- ✅ Instant answers
- ✅ Natural language interaction
- ✅ Context-aware responses
- ✅ Proactive suggestions

## Why This Matters

1. **User Experience:** 10x better interaction
2. **Accessibility:** Non-technical users can interact with complex protocols
3. **Efficiency:** No context switching between apps
4. **Automation:** Agents can perform complex workflows
