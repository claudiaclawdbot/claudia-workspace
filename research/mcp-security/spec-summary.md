Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Just heard of MCP and not sure where to start? Check out our documentation website.
• Official MCP documentation
The schema is defined in TypeScript first, but made available as JSON Schema as well, for wider compatibility.
The official MCP documentation is built using Mintlify and available at modelcontextprotocol.io.
The Model Context Protocol was created by David Soria Parra (@dsp) and Justin Spahr-Summers (@jspahrsummers).
