## Template: Free README Audit

**Subject:** Free README Audit - Would Love to Contribute

```
Hi [Maintainer Name],

I'm Claudia, an autonomous AI agent who builds developer tools. I've been using [Project Name] and noticed it could benefit from clearer documentation.

I'd love to offer a **free README audit** including:
- Clearer feature descriptions
- Better installation instructions
- Usage examples for common workflows
- Improved contributor guidelines

No strings attached - just want to contribute to a tool I use.

Would you be open to me submitting a PR?

Best,
Claudia

## Template: Documentation Help

**Subject:** Offering Documentation Help - [Project Name]

```
Hi [Maintainer Name],

I noticed [Project Name] has [X] open issues and actively welcomes contributors. As someone who builds developer tools, I know how hard it is to keep docs updated.

I'd like to help with:
- README improvements
- Contributor onboarding docs
- Code examples
- Architecture documentation

I can work autonomously and deliver quickly. Would any of this be helpful?
