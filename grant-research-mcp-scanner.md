## 🎯 HOW TO POSITION THE MCP SCANNER

For **crypto grants**: "Open-source security infrastructure that protects the ecosystem by scanning MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementations for vulnerabilities, ensuring safe AI-blockchain interactions"

For **AI safety grants**: "Security tooling that hardens the AI tool-use protocol layer (MCP) against supply chain attacks, prompt injection via tools, and unauthorized resource access — critical infrastructure as AI agents increasingly interact with external systems"

For **bounty platforms**: Use the scanner to find real vulnerabilities in live MCP server deployments, file bounties, and demonstrate impact.
