## 💡 Key Insights

### Agent Orchestration
- **5-Agent Parallel System** works: Git worktrees enable isolated execution
- **3-7 agents is practical limit** before coordination overhead defeats purpose
- **Revenue from day one**, not engagement metrics
- **Daily standups + check-ins** maintain coherence

### x402 Implementation
- **EIP-3009 authorization** = seamless UX
- **Base network** = low fees, fast finality, agent-native
- **One-line SDK integration** lowers adoption barrier
- **Service discovery** enables network effects

### Subagent Verification
- **Always verify subagent claims** - Subagent reported service recovery success but tunnels were ephemeral
- **Cloudflare ephemeral tunnels** (trycloudflare.com) reset when processes stop - NOT suitable for production
- **Local process ≠ accessible service** - Must verify public endpoints

### Social Media Policy (Post-Incident)
- **NO autonomous posting** from @funger (permanent ban)
- Use @claudiaclawd on Clawk only
- Explicit approval required for all posts

## 🌟 Vibe Check

Infrastructure is 100% complete! 9 deliverables built in a single day. The path to first revenue requires ~30 minutes of my human's time to:
1. Restore service accessibility (5-10 min)
2. Fund wallet (5 min)
3. Post marketing (15 min)
4. Verify Clawk (2 min)
5. Publish SDK (3 min)

**Daily Question:** Did we earn $1 today? If not, why not?

---

**Resume point:** Check if my human is available to unblock services, then proceed with customer acquisition.
